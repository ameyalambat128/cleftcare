# CleftCare Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env in the project root and update with your actual values

# ============================================================================
# Development/Production Mode
# ============================================================================
# Set to "production" for production builds, "development" for local development
EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV=development

# ============================================================================
# Express Backend Configuration (for Presigned Uploads)
# ============================================================================
# Base URL of your Express backend INCLUDING the /api prefix
# Development: http://localhost:3000/api
# Production: https://api.example.com/api
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:3000/api

# API key for authenticating with Express backend endpoints
# This is sent as X-API-Key header in requests to Express
EXPO_PUBLIC_EXPRESS_API_KEY=your-express-api-key-here

# ============================================================================
# Notes
# ============================================================================
# 
# For Production Deployment:
# - Set EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV=production
# - Update EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE to your production Express URL
# - Replace EXPO_PUBLIC_EXPRESS_API_KEY with your actual production API key
#
# Security:
# - Never commit the actual .env file to version control
# - Keep your API keys secure and rotate them regularly
# - Use different API keys for development and production
#
# Integration Flow:
# 1. App requests presigned URL from Express: POST /api/uploads/presign
# 2. App uploads audio directly to S3 using presigned URL
# 3. App submits all attempt keys to Express: POST /api/sentences/complete
# 4. Express calls FastAPI for GOP+OHM processing and returns results
#
# Required Express Endpoints:
# - POST /api/uploads/presign (returns presigned S3 URL and key)
# - POST /api/sentences/complete (processes all attempts via FastAPI)
#
